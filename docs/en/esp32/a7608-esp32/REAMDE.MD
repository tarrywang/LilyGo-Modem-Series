2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
3. Search for the `PlatformIO` plugin in the `Visual Studio Code` extension and install it.
4. After the installation is complete, you need to restart `Visual Studio Code`
5. After restarting `Visual Studio Code`, select `File` in the upper left corner of `Visual Studio Code` -> `Open Folder` -> select the `LilyGo-Modem-Series` directory
6. Wait for the installation of third-party dependent libraries to complete
7. Click on the `platformio.ini` file, and in the `platformio` column
8. Cancel the `;` symbol in front of the line `default_envs = T-A7608X` and use `T-A7608X` as the default environment
9. Uncomment one of the lines `src_dir = xxxx` to ensure that only one line is valid. For example, to enable `src_dir = examples/ATdebug`, remove the leading `;` symbol and save the file. The ATDebug example will now be compiled.

8. Upload sketch

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. Unable to upload any code? Please see the FAQ below
> 2. When opening the Arduino IDE, you will be prompted that there are new libraries that can be updated. Please do not click update. There is no guarantee that it can be compiled, run, etc. after the update. Make sure that the board is running normally before deciding whether to update. You have to Know that problems may occur after updating due to library differences, or the default configuration (such as TinyGSM) will be overwritten.
> 3. If it runs abnormally after the update, please follow Article 4 of the Arduino Quick Start to delete the directory in libraries, and drag the folder in lib into the libraries directory again.

### ⚡ Electrical parameters

| Features                        | Details |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| 🔗USB-C Input Voltage            | 5V      |
| ⚡Solar Input Voltage            | 5~6V    |
| ⚡USB-C/Solar Charge Max Current | 500mA   |
| 🔋Battery Voltage                | 3.7V    |
| 📍**VBUS** ( Pin header)         | 5V      |
| 📍**VBAT** ( Pin header)         | 4.2V    |

> \[!TIP]
>
> 1. The onboard JST2.0 interface is only used to connect the solar panel to charge the battery, and cannot provide power to the board from this interface
> 2. It is recommended to use a solar panel with an output voltage of 6V or 5V and a power of about 5-10W. Solar energy can only charge the battery. Without the battery, the panel cannot supply power.
> Please note that this is only a suggestion. It is not necessary to use a 5-10W solar panel. 1W is also acceptable.
> The size of the solar panel determines the current and speed of solar charging. Please note that depending on the environment,
> the sunshine time may not exceed one hour per day. At this time, if the solar panel is too small and the light is not sufficient, it cannot be charged.
> 3. Connect the VBUS pin to the USB-C power supply. If USB-C is present, the VBUS voltage is equal to the USB-C voltage. If USB-C is not present, there is no voltage on VBUS.
> 4. Connect the VBAT pin to the positive terminal of the battery. This pin can be used to connect an external battery directly to the VBAT pin. When using an external battery, it is best not to connect the battery to the development board's 18650 battery holder unless the battery's parameters are similar to the external battery. Batteries connected to the VBAT pin can be charged using the onboard charge management.

### FAQ

* **ESP32 (V1.x) version T-A7608  known issue**
  1. When using battery power mode, BOARD_POWERON_PIN (IO12) must be set to a high level after ESP32 starts, otherwise a reset will occur.
  2. Modem cannot be put into sleep mode when powered by USB-C. For a solution, see [here](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-A76XX/blob/main/examples/ModemSleep/README.MD)

* **If the above method still fails to upload the sketch, please follow the method below to test whether the USB2TTL communication is normal.**
  1. Connect USB-C to PC
  2. Open the serial monitor and adjust the baud rate to 115200
  3. Press the RST button on the board to restart
  4. If you can see the startup information, it means that the USB2TTL communication is normal. If nothing is displayed in the serial monitor, it may be that the USB2TTL bridge is damaged

* **Upgrade modem firmware**
  1. [T-A76XX Upgrade docs](../../../../docs/update_fw.md) / [Video](https://youtu.be/AZkm-Z7mKn8)

* **Unable to detect SIMCard?**
   1. Need to insert the SIMCard into the board first and then power on to detect the SIM card. If the order is reversed, it will report that the SIMCard cannot be detected.

* **Can't upload any sketch，Please enter the upload mode manually.**
   1. Connect the board via the USB cable
   2. Press and hold the **IO0** button , While still pressing the **IO0** button
   3. Press **RST** button
   4. Release the **RST** button
   5. Release the **IO0** button
   6. Upload sketch

* **What the onboard switch does**
  1. When using the internal battery pack, the switch will work normally to power/power down the board. However, if an external battery pack is used and connected to the VBAT pin, the switch will be bypassed, meaning the only way to shut down is to disconnect the battery.
  2. The switch is only for battery power and has no effect when plugged into USB

* **About VBUS Pin**
  1. VBUS Pin and USB-C are on the same line. Only when USB-C is connected, VBUS has voltage
  2. When only the battery is connected, VBUS has no voltage output
  3. If you want to connect an external power supply without connecting USB-C, VBUS Pin is the only voltage input pin. Please note that the maximum input of VBUS Pin is 5V, do not exceed 5V
