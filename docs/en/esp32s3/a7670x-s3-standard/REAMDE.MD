> \[!IMPORTANT]
> How to check the specific model version of the modem? Sending AT+SIMCOMATI can return the firmware version and hardware version used.
>
> Please note that whether the GNSS IPEX antenna connector is on the PCB or not depends on the actual modem version. The A7670G modem does not have internal GPS functionality, regardless of whether GPS is included in your order. If you purchased the A7670G with GPS, you will need to use an external GPS module.

### PlatformIO Quick Start

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Search for the `PlatformIO` plugin in the `Visual Studio Code` extension and install it.
3. After the installation is complete, you need to restart `Visual Studio Code`
4. After restarting `Visual Studio Code`, select `File` in the upper left corner of `Visual Studio Code` -> `Open Folder` -> select the `LilyGo-Modem-Series` directory
5. Wait for the installation of third-party dependent libraries to complete
6. Click on the `platformio.ini` file, and in the `platformio` column
7. Cancel the `;` symbol in front of the line `default_envs = T-A7670X-S3-Standard` and use `T-A7670X-S3-Standard` as the default environment
8. Uncomment one of the lines `src_dir = xxxx` to ensure that only one line is valid. For example, to enable `src_dir = examples/ATdebug`, remove the leading `;` symbol and save the file. The ATDebug example will now be compiled.
9. Click the (✔) symbol in the lower left corner to compile
10. Connect the board to the computer `ESP-USB` , `Modem-USB` is used for module firmware upgrade
11. Click (→) to upload firmware

7. Upload sketch

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. Unable to upload any code? Please see the FAQ below
> 2. When opening the Arduino IDE, you will be prompted that there are new libraries that can be updated. Please do not click update. There is no guarantee that it can be compiled, run, etc. after the update. Make sure that the board is running normally before deciding whether to update. You have to Know that problems may occur after updating due to library differences, or the default configuration (such as TinyGSM) will be overwritten.
> 3. If it runs abnormally after the update, please follow Article 3 of the Arduino Quick Start to delete the directory in libraries, and drag the folder in lib into the libraries directory again.

* The `Power Save Mode pin` is used to set the power capability of the power supply. Setting it to HIGH enables maximum power output. Setting it to LOW reduces current consumption.
* If a camera is connected externally, there will be no free GPIO. If the camera is not used, the camera's GPIO can be used for other purposes.
* `SDA`, `SCL` can only be used as I2C function, not as other functions
* `GPS Shield Wakeup Pin` is only used when an external GPS module is connected. Otherwise, it is idle. It is not recommended to use this GPIO. This IO is connected only when using `A7670G + L76K GPS`, otherwise it is not connected
* The camera must be powered on to be detected, otherwise the camera cannot be used. For how to turn it on, please refer to the Camera example.
* Modem RTS/Modem CTS are not connected by default. They are connected to the GPS RX/TX of the Modem by default. If you need to use them, you need to short-circuit the RTS/CTS short-circuit pads on the back of the PCB, and then separate the GPS TX and RX pads.
* `Camera RESET` : To maximize GPIO usage, no GPIO is assigned to the camera reset pin, so a power cycle is used to reset the camera.
The power-on sequence is: power on all cameras -> power off all cameras -> delay 300 milliseconds -> power on all cameras -> delay 100 milliseconds.
* `Camera PWD` : In order to maximize the use of GPIO, all GPIOs are not assigned to the camera PWD Pin. When the camera is not in use, you only need to turn off the camera power to completely turn off the power supply of the camera.
* `Camera Pins` : if the camera is not used, then all the pins assigned to the camera by default can be freely allocated and used without restrictions

### ⚡ Electrical parameters

| Features                        | Details   |
| ------------------------------- | --------- |
| 🔗USB-C input voltage range      | 4.5V~5.5V |
| 🔗VBUS Pin input voltage range   | 4.5V~5.5V |
| ⚡Solar Input Voltage            | 5 ~ 6V    |
| ⚡USB-C/Solar Charge Max Current | 500mA     |
| 🔋Battery Voltage                | 3.7V      |
| 🔋Battery socket voltage range   | 3.4~4.3V  |

* The minimum voltage of battery power supply depends on the discharge capacity of the battery. The minimum power supply voltage test using a voltage regulator can be as low as 2.7V (due to the low voltage stability of the voltage regulator)
* The VBUS pin is on the same line as the USB-C port. When connected to USB-C, the VBUS pin will also have voltage. The VBUS pin can only be used for external power input and will not provide power to the outside.

> \[!TIP]
>
> 1. The onboard JST2.0 interface is only used to connect the solar panel to charge the battery, and cannot provide power to the board from this interface
> 2. It is recommended to use a solar panel with an output voltage of 6V or 5V and a power of about 5-10W. Solar energy can only charge the battery. Without the battery, the panel cannot supply power.
> Please note that this is only a suggestion. It is not necessary to use a 5-10W solar panel. 1W is also acceptable.
> The size of the solar panel determines the current and speed of solar charging. Please note that depending on the environment,
> the sunshine time may not exceed one hour per day. At this time, if the solar panel is too small and the light is not sufficient, it cannot be charged.

### ⚡Battery Protector Description

| Features                | Details  |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Over-Voltage Threshold  | 4.30V    |
| Under-Voltage Threshold | 2.4V     |
| Over-Charge Current     | 3.6A     |
| Over-Discharge Current  | 4.6A     |
| Short-Circuit Current   | 2 × 4.6A |

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the development board will not power on when connected to an 18650 battery. To activate battery power, you can use the following method to activate the BMS.
>
> Method: Plug into the USB-C port labeled ESP-USB. Please note that the Modem-USB port will not power or charge the development board.
>
> Please note that even if the power switch is off, you still need to activate the BMS as described above to power the development board.
> If you briefly turn the power switch off, turning it back on will also reconnect the battery power, eliminating the need to reconnect the USB port to activate the BMS.

### FAQ

* **Upgrade modem firmware**
  1. [T-A76XX Upgrade docs](../../../../docs/update_fw.md) / [Video](https://youtu.be/AZkm-Z7mKn8)

* **Unable to detect SIMCard?**
   1. Need to insert the SIMCard into the board first and then power on to detect the SIM card. If the order is reversed, it will report that the SIMCard cannot be detected.

* **Can't upload any sketch，Please enter the upload mode manually.**
   1. Connect the board via the USB cable
   2. Press and hold the **BOOT** button , While still pressing the **BOOT** button
   3. Press **RST** button
   4. Release the **RST** button
   5. Release the **BOOT** button
   6. Upload sketch

* **What the onboard switch does**
  1. When using the internal battery pack, the switch will work normally to power/power down the board. However, if an external battery pack is used and connected to the VBAT pin, the switch will be bypassed, meaning the only way to shut down is to disconnect the battery.
  2. The switch is only for battery power and has no effect when plugged into USB
  3. To activate battery power, please see the `Battery Protector Description` above.

* **About VBUS Pin**
  1. VBUS Pin and USB-C are on the same line. Only when USB-C is connected, VBUS has voltage
  2. When only the battery is connected, VBUS has no voltage output
  3. If you want to connect an external power supply without connecting USB-C, VBUS Pin is the only voltage input pin. Please note that the maximum input of VBUS Pin is 5V, do not exceed 5V
